# Installation Details

Prior to own `{eprscope}` ðŸ“¦ installation a minimal system setup is required and can be followed by these steps âž¨

1.  Installation of *JDK Development Kit* where the corresponding package, suitable for your operating system, can be downloaded from the [official *Oracle* website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886).

2.  Please, follow the instructions for the [base ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} installation and setup](https://cran.r-project.org/).

3.  Download and install [*RStudio IDE*](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (Integrated Development Environment).

4.  Download and install the latest release of [*Rtools* (WINDOWS only)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) or on *macOS/Linux* [follow the instructions to install *CMake*](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/). Alternatively, on *macOS*, *CMake* can be set up through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) repository (see also <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmake#default>). This step is required to use the `{nloptr}` ðŸ“¦ for the fitting of EPR spectra.

5.  In the ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} *Console* (lower left panel within the *RStudio IDE*) run the following code in order to install essential ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} packages for data science with all their dependencies âž¨

    ```{r essential-r-packages,eval = FALSE,echo = TRUE}

    install.packages("tidyverse",dependencies = TRUE)
    #
    ## additional packages required by the `{eprscope}`:
    install.packages(
      c("DT","vctrs","npreg","patchwork","kableExtra",
        "htmlwidgets","webshot2","tinytable","gsignal",
        "shiny","shinythemes"),
      dependencies = TRUE
    )

    ```

There are two options how to install the `{eprscope}` ðŸ“¦ via the ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} *Console* âž¨

```{r install-eprscope-01-opt,eval = FALSE,echo = TRUE}

# from the GitHub repository:
if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope")

```

or

```{r install-eprscope-02-opt,eval = FALSE,echo = TRUE}

# from the R-Universe (https://r-universe.dev/search)
# and CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) repositories:
install.packages(
  "eprscope",
  repos = c(
    "https://jatanrt.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)

```

If one wants to install the entire ðŸ“¦ including all the documentation vignettes/articles âž¨

```{r install-eprscope-03-opt,eval = FALSE,echo = TRUE}

if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope",build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

# First Steps in ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="28" height="21"} Statistical Language

In this section, only essential syntax and basic commands to run the `{eprscope}` functions will be described. For details or more advanced programming experience, please refer to the resources in [*README* file/Homepage](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/index.html).

## Variable/Function Names and Assignment

Any name, even the complex one (see vide infra), can be applied to assign the variables/functions. It is common to use complex names with the parts separated either by underscore `..._...` or by point, like stated in the example below. Both assignment operators (`<-` and `=`) can be used in ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} language. However, the application of the first one is preferred, due to the fact that the `=` is a pure asignment operator and it does not neccessarily initialize a variable in the namespace (e.g. as arguments in a function, see below). Whereas, the `<-` always creates a variable [@assignR2018; @assignRb; @RPeters2020; @wickham2019]. In order to improve the code readability, comments might be included, starting with the "hashtag" `#` like already shown in the installation code above.

```{r names-assignments}

# Q value (EPR sensitivity instrumental factor) assignment
Q_value <- 3500
#
# loading package built-in example file/data => "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.asc",
# which corresponds to EPR spectrum of Wuster's blue
tmpd.data.file <- load_data_example(file = "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.asc")

```

The `file` within the parentheses represents an **argument of the function** `load_data_example()` , however **its assignment must be solely provided by the `=` operator.** If several arguments are defined, they have to be separated by `,` ("comma").

## Functions and Packages

Packages are fundamental units of shareable code. They may bundle functions, sample code, datasets, documentation and tests [@GfG2023; @wickham2023]. By default, during the ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} installation, only a couple of packages are set up (e.g. `{base}` , `{datasets}` , `{graphics}` , `{grdevices}` , `{stats}` , `{utils}` ). These are also immediately available, once you start the ![](RcoreLogo.png){width="16" height="12"} console. Additional packages must by installed and loaded explicitly in order to be utilized. To load such packages, the function `library()` have to be executed. It actually refers to the place (folder) where the ðŸ“¦ is stored on your computer. e.g. like loading collection of the essential data science packages ([{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/), already mentioned above):

```{r loading-tidyverse}

library(tidyverse)

```
