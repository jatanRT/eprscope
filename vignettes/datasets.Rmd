# Built-In Datasets

There are two important datasets built into the `{eprscope}` 📦. The first one is the nuclear isotope table, summarizing the essential properties of nuclei in order to analyze the EPR spectra with HF (hyperfine) structure. While, the second one shows the solvent properties important for variable temperature (VT), double-resonance (ENDOR) and EPR spectroelectrochemical experiments.

## Nuclear Isotope Data Frame

This dataset was taken from the open source [*EasySpin*](https://easyspin.org/easyspin/documentation/isotopetable.html) package, reformatted and column of Larmor-frequencies in $\mathrm{MHz}$ at $0.35\,\mathrm{mT}$ were added for better orientation in double-resonance ENDOR spectra, see the details in `?isotopes_ds` documentation as well as [R file in \`data-raw\` folder](https://github.com/jatanRT/eprscope/blob/master/data-raw/isotopes_ds.R). The data frame is not only used to analyze the ENDOR spectra, however it is also essential for the simulations of EPR spectra and their fitting onto the experimental ones. See the documentation of the `eval_sim_EPR_iso()`, `eval_sim_EPR_isoFit()` , `plot_eval_EPRtheo_mltiplet()` as well as `eval_nu_ENDOR()` and `eval_sim_EPR_isoFit_space()`.

```{r nuclear-dataset}

# interactive data frame by `{DT}` package with option to select columns
# and to save table as `.csv`, `.pdf` or `.xlsx` format
DT::datatable(isotopes_ds,
  extensions = "Buttons",
  options = list(
    dom = "Bfrtip",
    buttons = c("colvis","csv","pdf","excel")
  ),
  caption = "Dataset with the following variables/columns: Proton number, isotope,
  stability (either stable, STB or radio-active, RA), isotope name, 
  nuclear spin quantum number, nuclear g-value, natural abundance in %, 
  nuclear quadrupolar moment in Barns and the ENDOR/Larmor frequency 
  in MHz at 0.35 T. The negative sign of Larmor frequency values 
  points to clockwise precession direction according to convention."
  ) %>%
  DT::formatRound("nu_ENDOR_MHz_035T",digits = 3) # rounding must be also performed by the `DT` pkg.

## Solvent Properties

When performing EPR experiments, especially the **X-band continuous wave (CW) spectroscopy in solution**, solvent plays an important role. Namely, prior to measurement one has to decide which type of cell will be applied depending on solvent polarity. For polar solvents, such as acetonitrile or dimethyl sulfoxide, either capillary (with $i.d. \leq 1\,\mathrm{mm}$ ) or special [quartz flat cell](https://sp-wilmadlabglass.com/product/standard-te102-aqueous-cells/) ( with a flat-part thickness $\approx (0.3-0.6)\,\mathrm{mm}$) must be used. Whereas for the non-polar solvents, or those with lower polarity, e.g. toluene, chloroform or tetrahydrofuran, a sample can be analyzed within any kind of cell including [common EPR quartz-tubes](https://sp-wilmadlabglass.com/product/4-mm-thin-wall-quartz-epr-sample-tube-250-mm-l/) with $i.d. \approx (2-4)\,\mathrm{mm}$. Additionally, the solvent properties like melting/boiling point as well as viscosity are essential for the variable temperature (VT) experiments and particularly for the CW ENDOR as well as for spectroelectrochemical ones. Table details can be found in the `?solvents_ds` documentation and in the [R file in \`data-raw\` folder](https://github.com/jatanRT/eprscope/blob/master/data-raw/solvents_ds.R). Solvent properties can be also obtained by the specialized `readEPR_solvent_props()` function.

```{r solvent-properties}

# similar interactive table like before
DT::datatable(solvents_ds,
  extensions = "Buttons",
  options = list(
    dom = "Bfrtip",
    buttons = c("colvis","csv","pdf","excel"),
    columnDefs = list(list(visible=FALSE, targets=c(7))) # hide solubility/miscibility column 
  ),
  caption = "Dataset with the following variables/columns: solvent name, 
  molecular formula, relative molecular weight, boiling point in °C, 
  melting point in °C, density in g/mL, solubility 
  in g/(100 g of water)-not shown, visibility can be switched 
  by the 'column visibility', relative electric permittivity, 
  flash point in °C and dynamic viscosity in cp."
)

# Datasets for Examples and Tests

These involve the [ASCII text](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/ascii.htm) and [binary data](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/binary.htm) (with the extensions like `.txt` , `.asc` , `.csv` , `.DTA` and `.spc` or `.YGF`) coming from EPR spectrometers and correspond either to an EPR spectrum data frame[^1] or accompanying ASCII text files with the (instrumental) parameters (having the `.par` or `.DSC` / `.dsc` extensions) used to record the corresponding spectra (see also the `vignette("functionality")` vignette/article). While the binary files and those containing parameters are generated automatically during the data saving, text data files must be generated by the instrument operator (usually by `File` ➝ `Export ASCII` workflow) within the acquisition/processing software. Some of these files are compressed (as `.zip`) in order to save storage space within the package. Additionally, the `{eprscope}` 📦 contains `.mat` (*Matlab*) file from the *EasySpin* simulation as well as output from DFT quantum chemical computation or related structural data either with `.inp.log.zip` or `.sdf` extensions, respectively. All these file types are summarized within the following table.

[^1]: Usually the following variables/columns are included in the ASCII tables of the corresponding EPR spectra: "**index**", "**Field [G]**"/"**X [G]**"/"**RF [MHz]**" and "**Intensity []**"/"**Intensity**"

| **Binary data file**, including the EPR spectrum derivative intensity of electrochemically generated TMPD^.+^. The radical cation was formed during cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment acquired simultaneously with the EPR in order to follow the TMPD^.+^ concentration changes in real time. The combined CV-EPR experiment was performed in 0.3 M TBAPF~6~/DMSO solution by application of -0.1 V ⟶ +0.45 V ⟶ -0.1 V potential ramp (vs Ag-quasiref. electrode) and by the scan rate of 3 mV/s. Sample was measured in a special quartz EPR flat cell, enabling EPR experiments in highly polar media. Those files, named as `TMPD_specelchem_accu_b`, are related to the actual one.

| ASCII **text table file including double integrals (Area) vs. time** and additional parameters like g-value, linewidth, lineshape of each CW EPR spectrum of a triarylamine radical cation, recorded right after its electrochemical oxidative generation and disconnecting the potentiostat. File was created by the *Xenon* acquisition software, where the integration of the simulated as well as fitted EPR spectra wa performed. Potentiostatic electrolysis (at 0.49 V vs Fc/Fc^+^) and EPR measurements were carried out in 0.2 M TBAPF~6~/CH~3~CN triarylamine solution. The individual spectral data are stored in `Triarylamine_radCat_decay_series.zip` .                                                                                                                | `eval_kinR_EPR_ODE_model()`   |
