# eprscope

## Overview ![](reference/figures/logo_new.png)

The key objective of this open source
![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) package is to bring handy
functions corresponding to “everyday” data processing/analysis in the
EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance_(Jenschke)))
spectroscopy mainly in chemistry. Similar
![](https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/community/logos/python-logo-only.png)
tools like [cwepr](https://www.cwepr.de/index) and the [related
projetcs](https://docs.cwepr.de/v0.5/) have been developed, so far. The
[eprscope](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/), as the first complex
![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)**package** 📦 for EPR,
**doesn’t want to replace the latter nor the excellent and standard EPR
simulation/processing** [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/)
for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and its
additional frameworks like
[SpecProFi](https://www.radicals.uni-freiburg.de/de/software) or [CW EPR
Scripts by Emilien
Etienne](https://bip.cnrs.fr/epr-facility/software-and-scripts/).
Rather, **it may be considered like a complementary** 📦 **or toolbox
with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by several
proprietary tools**. For instance, like acquisition/processing software,
supplied by the EPR spectrometer manufacturers (see
e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html))
as well as several other software platforms like the *MS Office* and/or
*Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* which are often applied in the EPR
processing/analysis workflow. Therefore, the
[eprscope](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/) tries to reduce such
many steps/programs if the above-mentioned software combination would be
adopted. In order to achieve the goal it uses superior power of the open
source ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) ecosystem that combines
data processing, analysis and great scientific visualizations together
with the extensive publishing capabilities by
[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) and
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Everything at one place (see the [RStudio
IDE](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/) or
[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/)) without the need to switch
between or employ any other additional software.

## Installation

**Prior to own** [eprscope](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/) 📦
**installation a minimal system setup is required** and summarized into
the following steps:

1.  Installation of *JDK Development Kit* where the corresponding
    package, suitable for your operating system, can be downloaded from
    the [official *Oracle*
    website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886)
    (this is needed in order to properly run the
    [`draw_molecule_by_rcdk()`](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/reference/draw_molecule_by_rcdk.md)
    function). A second option would be the installation of the latest
    GPL-licensed [*OpenJDK*](https://jdk.java.net/) package. *WINDOWS*
    users may follow instructions at the official site of [British
    Columbia Institute of
    Technology](https://kb.bcit.ca/faculty-staff/download-and-install-openjdk-on-windows10-3395/).
    On *macOS,* this package is available via Homebrew repository (see
    below) by `brew install openjdk` and finally, by verifying the
    installation: `java –version`. *Linux* (ubuntu) users are advised to
    check out the repositories (+ update, if needed): `sudo apt update`.
    Then search for the `openjdk` by the following command:
    `apt search openjdk` (it should return list with the newest/stable
    version like `openjdk-XX-jdk`, “XX” stands for the highest number),
    and finally install it by `sudo apt install openjdk-XX-jdk -y`.
    After successful installation one may check the version
    (`java -version`) .

2.  Please, follow the instructions for the [the R installation
    procedure](https://cran.rstudio.com/). *Linux* and *macOS* users may
    also update where the ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)
    expects to find various *Java* files by `sudo R CMD javareconf` (in
    terminal, not in the R console), afterwards. If one gets an error
    about `jni.h` not being found, then try:
    `sudo R CMD javareconf JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-XX-openjdk-amd64/`
    (find your path for the *Java* files).

3.  Download and install [*RStudio
    IDE*](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (Integrated
    Development Environment). Alternatively, one may also try the
    corresponding cloud version without the need for an
    ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) installation either
    available at [Posit Cloud](https://docs.posit.co/cloud/get_started/)
    or at [CoCalc (Collaborative Calculation and Data
    Science)](https://cocalc.com/features). Any other
    ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) compatible environment like
    [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
    [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) may be installed as well.

4.  Download and install the latest release of [*Rtools* (WINDOWS
    only)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) or on
    *macOS/Linux* [follow the instructions to install
    *CMake*](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/). Alternatively, on
    *macOS*, *CMake* can be set up via the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    repository (see also
    <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmake#default>). This step is
    required to use the [nloptr](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr) 📦
    for the fitting of isotropic EPR spectra.

5.  In the ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)*Console* (lower left
    panel within the *RStudio IDE*) run the following code in order to
    install essential ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) packages
    for data science with all their dependencies ➨

    ``` r

    # run code in the R console
    #
    # after the initial R environment setup it's always 
    # good to install essential collection of packages for data science 
    install.packages("tidyverse",dependencies = TRUE)
    # ...+ additional required packages with dependencies
    install.packages(
      c("bookdown","kableExtra","tinytable",
        "corrplot","animation","openxlsx","knitr",
        "shinythemes","numDeriv","htmlwidgets",
        "esquisse","nlstools","webshot2"),
      dependencies = TRUE
    )
    ```

**There are two main options how to install the
[eprscope](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/)** 📦 **via the**
![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)***Console*** ➨

``` r

# from the GitHub repository:
if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope")
```

or

``` r

# from the R-Universe (https://r-universe.dev/search)
# and CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) repositories:
install.packages(
  "eprscope",
  repos = c(
    "https://jatanrt.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

If one wants to install the entire 📦 including all the documentation
vignettes/articles ➨

``` r

# alternatively, install package together with all the vignettes/articles:
if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Additionally, **the open-source scientific and technical publishing
system** [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) together with the
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), **a document converter system**, may be
required for sharing the results coming from
[eprscope](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/) in desired formats like
`pdf` , `html` , `docx` , `pptx` or `tex` (details may be found in the
[`create_qmdReport_proj()`](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/reference/create_qmdReport_proj.md)
documentation).

## Updates

To update the [eprscope](https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/) 📦, just
run the following code (the same as for the installation) in the
![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) console ➨

``` r

devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope")
#
# update package together with vignettes/articles:
# devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

In this section, couple of examples are shown in order to briefly
demonstrate the package functionality. More detailed description can be
found within the articles/vignettes or documentation examples.
