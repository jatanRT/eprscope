the \code{\link[grDevices]{plotmath}} notation, like \code{rate.const.unit = "M^{-1}~s^{-1}"}

\description{
Finding the temperature-dependence of a rate constant (\eqn{k}) related to the elementary radical reaction, using the essential
  transition state theory (TST). The activation parameters, such as \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o} and \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} H^o}
  are obtained either by the non-linear fit (see the general \code{\link[stats]{nls}} R function) or by the linear fit
  (using the \code{\link[stats]{lm}}) of the Eyring expression (or its logarithmic linear form) on the original
  \eqn{k} \emph{vs} \eqn{T} relation (please, refer to the \code{data.kvT} argument). The latter can be acquired
  by the \code{\link{eval_kinR_EPR_modelFit}} from sigmoid-integrals of the EPR spectra recorded at different temperatures.
  Finally, the activation Gibbs energy (\eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} G^o}) is calculated, using the optimized \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o}
  and \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} H^o}, for each temperature in the series.

\details{
The basic assumption of the Transition State Theory (TST) is the existence of activated state/complex, formed
  by the collision of reactant molecules, which does not actually lead to reaction products directly. The activated state (AS)
  is formed as highly energized, and therefore as an unstable intermediate, decomposing into products of the reaction.
  Accordingly, the reaction rate is given by the rate of its decomposition. Additional important assumption for TST
  is the presence of pre-equilibrium (characterized by the \eqn{K^{\ddagger}} constant) of the reactants with
  the activated complex (AC). Because the latter is not stable, it dissociates with motion along the corresponding
  bond-stretching coordinate. For this reason, the rate constant (\eqn{k}) must be related to the associated vibration
  frequency (\eqn{\nu}). Thus, every time, if the AC is formed, the \eqn{k} of AC-dissociation
  actually equals to \eqn{\nu}. Nevertheless, it is possible that the AC will revert back to reactants and therefore,
  only a fraction of ACs will lead to product(s). Such situation is reflected by the transmission coefficient \eqn{\kappa}
  (see also the argument \code{transmiss.coeff}), where \eqn{k = \kappa\,\nu}.

  According to statistical thermodynamics, the equilibrium constant can be expressed by the partition function (\eqn{q})
  of the reactants and that of the AC. By definition, each \eqn{q} corresponds to ratio of total number of particles
  to the number of particles in the ground state. In essence, it is the measure of degree to which the particles
  are spread out (partitioned among) over the energy levels. Therefore, taking into account the energies of a harmonic quantum
  oscillator vibrating along the reaction coordinate as well as partition functions of the AC and those of the reactants,
  the rate constant can be expressed as follows (see e.g. Ptáček P, Šoukal F, Opravil T (2018) in the \code{References}):
  \deqn{k = \kappa\,(k_{\text{B}}\,T\,/\,h)\,K^{\ddagger}}
  where the \eqn{k_{\text{B}}} and \eqn{h} are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively, \eqn{T} corresponds
  to temperature and finally, the \eqn{K^{\ddagger}} represents the equilibrium constant including the partition functions
  of reactants and that of the AC. In order to evaluate the AC partition function, its structure must be known.
  However, often, due to the lack of structural information, it is difficult (if not impossible) to evaluate
  the corresponding \eqn{q^{\ddagger}(\text{AC})}. Therefore, considering the equilibrium between the reactants and the AC,
  one may express the \eqn{K^{\ddagger}} in terms of \emph{Gibbs} activation energy (\eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} G^o}),
  because \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} G^o = - R\,T\,ln K^{\ddagger}} and thus the Eyring equation reads:
  \deqn{k = \kappa\,(k_{\text{B}}\,T\,/\,h)\,exp[- (\Delta^{\ddagger} G^o)/(R\,T)] =
  \kappa\,(k_{\text{B}}\,T\,/\,h)\,exp[- (\Delta^{\ddagger} H^o)/(R\,T)]\,exp[\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o / R]}
  where \eqn{R\approx 8.31446\,\text{J}\,\text{mol}^{-1}\,\text{K}^{-1}} is the universal gas constant and the upper index \eqn{^o}
  denotes the standard molar state (see IUPAC (2019) in the \code{References}). Previous formula is applied
  as a model to fit the experimental \eqn{k\,\,vs\,\,T} (see the argument \code{data.kvT}) relation, where both
  the \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o} and the \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} H^o} (in the graphical output, are also denoted as
  \eqn{\Delta^{active} S^o} and \eqn{\Delta^{active} H^o}, respectively) are optimized using the \code{fit.method}
  (by the \code{\link[stats]{nls}} function). In the first approach, both latter are considered as temperature independent
  within the selected temperature range. Often, the Eyring equation is not applied in the original form,
  however in the linear one,like
  \deqn{ln(k\,/\,T) = - (\Delta^{\ddagger} H^o)\,/\,(R\,T) + (\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o\,/\,R) + ln(\kappa\,k_{\text{B}}\,/\,h)}
  with the slope/coefficient \eqn{- (\Delta^{\ddagger} H^o)\,/\,R}
  and the \eqn{(\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o\,/\,R) + ln(\kappa\,k_{\text{B}}\,/\,h)}
  as intercept of the \eqn{ln(k\,/\,T)\,\,vs\,\,1/T} relation. Nevertheless, the latter is not recommended as a model for fitting
  the experimental \eqn{k(T)} (see also Lente G, Fábián I, Poë AJ (2005) in the \code{References}).
  The reason inherits in the misinterpretation of the extrapolation to \eqn{T\rightarrow \infty} (or \eqn{1/T\rightarrow 0})
  by which the \eqn{\Delta^{\ddagger} S^o} is obtained and thus it is unreliable. Accordingly, \strong{the original exponential
  Eyring form is recommended} as a model to fit the experimental \eqn{k(T)}. Contrary, it may happen that \eqn{k\,\,vs\,\,T}
  can vary in several (\eqn{\approx 2-3}) orders of magnitude within the studied temperature range and therefore, it is necessary
  to proportionally weight the \eqn{k} (see also Lente G, Fábián I, Poë AJ (2005) in the \code{References}). For the linear form,
  weighting does not make a difference because the transformed \eqn{ln(k\,/\,T)} span over a narrow range of values.
  Therefore, it is advisable to perform the original exponential fit as well as the linear one within the studied temperature range
  and compare both outcomes (both methods are involved in this function, see the argument \code{fit.method}).
  The \href{https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/E02142}{\eqn{k}-unit depends on the molecularity of the reaction},
  please also refer to the \code{rate.const.unit} argument. Therefore, the left hand site of the Eyring equation above
  must be multiplied by the standard molar concentration \eqn{c^o = 1\,\text{mol}\,\text{dm}^{-3}}:
  \deqn{k\,(c^o)^{- \sum_i \nu_i^{\ddagger}}}
  where the \eqn{\sum_i \nu_i^{\ddagger}} goes through stoichiometric coefficients (including the negative sign for reactants)
  of the AC formation reaction (therefore the index \eqn{^{\ddagger}} is used), i.e. for the bi-molecular reaction,
  the sum results in \code{-1}, however for the mono-molecular one, the sum results in \code{0}.

  While the transition state theory (TST) is a helpful tool to get information about the mechanism
  of an elementary reaction, it has some limitations, particularly for radical reactions. Couple of them are listed below.
  \enumerate{
  \item One should be very careful if applied to elementary steps in a multistep reaction kinetics (like
  consecutive reactions, example shown in \code{\link{eval_kinR_ODE_model}}). If the intermediate (e.g. in the consecutive
  reaction mechanism) possesses a short life-time, the TST probably fails.

  \item For very fast reactions the assumed equilibrium between the reactants and the AC won't be reached.
  Therefore, the spin trapping reactions, which \eqn{k}s may actually fall into the order
  of \eqn{10^9\,\text{dm}^3\,\text{mol}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-1}} (or oven higher, see Kemp TJ (1999) in the \code{References})
  should be taken with extreme caution in terms of TST.

  \item Formation of AC in TST is based on classical mechanics, that is molecules/atoms will only collide,
  having enough energy (to form the AC), otherwise reaction does not occur. Whereas, taking into account the quantum
  mechanical principle, molecules/atoms with any finite energy may (with a certain probability) tunnel across
  the energy barrier. Such effect will be less probable for high energy barriers, however e.g. for radical-radical
  recombination, where the barriers are typically very low, the tunneling probability is high and TST may fail.
  In addition, such reactions proceed relatively fast and therefore the TST (Eyring fit) can also strongly bias
  the activation parameters. This type of reactions may also exhibit negative \eqn{k\,\,vs\,\,T} dependence
  (see Wardlaw DM and Marcus RA (1986) in the \code{References}).
