<p>There are two important datasets built into the
<a href="https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/">eprscope</a> 📦. The first one is the nuclear isotope table,
summarizing the essential properties of nuclei in order to analyze the
EPR spectra with HF (hyperfine) structure. While, the second one shows
the solvent properties important for variable temperature (VT),
double-resonance (ENDOR) and EPR spectroelectrochemical experiments.</p>

were added for better orientation in double-resonance ENDOR spectra, see
the details in <code><a href="../reference/isotopes_ds.html">?isotopes_ds</a></code> documentation as well as <a href="https://github.com/jatanRT/eprscope/blob/master/data-raw/isotopes_ds.R" class="external-link">R
file in `data-raw` folder</a>. The data frame is not only used to
analyze the ENDOR spectra however, it is also essential for the
simulations of EPR spectra and their fitting onto the experimental ones.

<p>When performing EPR experiments, especially the <strong>X-band
continuous wave (CW) spectroscopy in solution</strong>, solvent plays an
important role. Namely, prior to measurement one has to decide which
type of cell will be applied depending on solvent polarity. For polar
solvents, such as acetonitrile or dimethyl sulfoxide, either capillary
(with

must be used. While for non-polar solvents or those with lower polarity,
e.g. toluene, chloroform or tetrahydrofuran, a sample can be analyzed
within any kind of cell including <a href="https://sp-wilmadlabglass.com/product/4-mm-thin-wall-quartz-epr-sample-tube-250-mm-l/" class="external-link">common

Additionally, the solvent properties like melting/boiling point as well
as viscosity are essential for the variable temperature (VT) experiments
and particularly for the CW ENDOR as well as for spectroelectrochemical
ones. Table details can be found in the <code><a href="../reference/solvents_ds.html">?solvents_ds</a></code>
documentation and in the <a href="https://github.com/jatanRT/eprscope/blob/master/data-raw/solvents_ds.R" class="external-link">R
file in `data-raw` folder</a>. Solvent properties can be also obtained
by the specialized <code><a href="../reference/readEPR_solvent_props.html">readEPR_solvent_props()</a></code> function.</p>

<p>These involve the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/ascii.htm" class="external-link">ASCII text</a>
data (with the extensions like <code>.txt</code> , <code>.asc</code> ,
<code>.csv</code> ), coming from EPR spectrometers and correspond either

(instrumental) parameters (having the <code>.par</code> or
<code>.DSC</code> / <code>.dsc</code> extensions) used to record the
corresponding spectra. While the files containing parameters are
generated automatically during the data saving, the tabular ones,
related to an EPR spectrum, must be generated by the instrument operator
(usually by <code>File</code> ➝ <code>Export ASCII</code> workflow).
Some of these files are compressed (as <code>.zip</code>) in order to
save storage space within the package. Additionally, the
<a href="https://jatanrt.github.io/eprscope/">eprscope</a> 📦 contains <code>.mat</code> (<em>Matlab</em>)
file from the <em>EasySpin</em> simulation as well as output from DFT
quantum chemical computation or related structural data either with
<code>.inp.log.zip</code> or <code>.sdf</code> extensions, respectively.
