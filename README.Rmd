## Overview <img src="man/figures/logo_new.png" align="right" height="104"/>

The key objective of this open source ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="16" height="16"} package is to bring handy functions corresponding to "everyday" data processing/analysis in the EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic Resonance](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance_(Jenschke))) spectroscopy mainly in chemistry. Similar ![](https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/community/logos/python-logo-only.png){width="16" height="16"} tools like [cwepr](https://www.cwepr.de/index) and the [related projetcs](https://docs.cwepr.de/v0.5/) have been devoloped, so far. The `{eprscope}` 📦 doesn't want to replace the latter nor the excellent EPR simulation/processing [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and its additional frameworks like [SpecProFi](https://www.radicals.uni-freiburg.de/de/software) or [CW EPR Scripts by Emilien Etienne](https://bip.cnrs.fr/epr-facility/software-and-scripts/). Rather, it may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by several proprietary tools. For instance, like acquisition/processing software, supplied by the EPR spectrometer manufacturers (see e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)) as well as several other software platforms like the *MS Office* and/or *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* which are often applied in the EPR processing workflow. Therefore, the `{eprscope}` also tries to reduce such many steps if the above-mentioned software combination would be adopted. In order to achieve the goal the package uses superior power or the open source ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="16" height="16"} ecosystem that combines data processing, analysis and great scientific visualizations together with the extensive publishing capabilities by [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) tools. Everything at one place without the need to switch between or employ any additional software.

## Installation

Before the installation, please make sure that you have already followed instructions for the [{nloptr} package installation](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) depending on your operating system. This package is required for the proper running of optimization/fitting functions of the `{eprscope}` .

```{r installation}

# So far, the package can be installed by =>

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope.git")

```

Completely new <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/> users or people who haven't already installed the *R* environment, please consult ➨

1.  [the R installation procedure](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

2.  [installation of the Rstudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3.  [the latest R tools release](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html) **ONLY for WINDOWS OS**

Additionally, **an open-source scientific and technical publishing system** [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) together with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), **a document converter system**, may be needed for sharing the results coming from `{eprscope}` in desired formats like `pdf` , `html` , `docx` , `pptx` or `tex`.

## Usage

In this section couple of examples are shown in order to briefly demonstrate functionality of the package. More detailed description can be found within the package articles/vignettes or documentation examples.

### Reading Files with Instrumental Parameters

```{r parameter-reading,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#
# loading the package/library
library(eprscope)
#
# loading the built-in package file => "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.par"
tmpd.params.file <- 
  load_data_example(file = "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.par")
#
# parameters into interactive table (data frame)
tmpd.params.dt <- 
  readEPR_params_tabs(path_to_dsc_par = tmpd.params.file,
                      origin = "winepr",
                      interact = "params")
#
# table preview
tmpd.params.dt

```

### Depict Molecular Structures

```{r molecule-drawing,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Phenylalenyl (Perinaphthenyl or PNT) radical from `SMILES` code
# "C1([C.]23)=CC=CC2=CC=CC3=CC=C1" code
draw_molecule_by_rcdk(molecule = "C1([C.]23)=CC=CC2=CC=CC3=CC=C1",
                      mol.label = "Phenylalenyl",
                      mol.label.color = "black",
                      mol.label.xy.posit = c(8.8,1.2))

```

### Simulation of Isotropic EPR Spectra

```{r spectra-simulation,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Simulation of the phenylalenyl (perinaphthenyl or PNT) radical,
# see also https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2006/CS/b500509b.
# The additional experimental/instrumental parameters are not shown,
# and posses their default values => see the corresponding documentation 
# of `eval_sim_EPR_iso()` function.
#
simulation.iso <- 
  eval_sim_EPR_iso(g.iso = 2.0027,
                   B.unit = "G",
                   nuclear.system = list(
                     list("1H",3,5.09),
                     list("1H",6,17.67)
                     ),
                   natur.abund = T,
                   lineGL.DeltaB = list(0.42,NULL))
#
# simulation spectrum preview in the region from 3462 G to 3528 G
simulation.iso$plot + ggplot2::coord_cartesian(xlim = c(3462,3528))

```

## Help, Questions and Contribution

There are several ways how to get help. If the users are already familiar with the [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) please, follow either the individual package function documentation or the corresponding articles/vignettes. These might be also considered as a kind of EPR spectroscopy knowledge source. **In case you are new to *R***, there are couple of great tutorials enabling a quite straightforward diving into <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/>. **Please, refer to e.g.**
