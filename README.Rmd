# Overview <img src="man/figures/logo_new.png" align="right" height="139"/>

The main goal of this package is to bring handy functions corresponding to "everyday" data processing/operations in EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic Resonance](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/E02005)) spectroscopy. The package doesn't want to replace the great EPR simulation/processing [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) . Rather, it may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by the combination of acquisition/processing software supplied by the EPR spectrometer manufacturers (see e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)) as well as several proprietary software platforms like *MS Office*, *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* (in general text editing and graphing software).

# Installation
