## Overview <img src="man/figures/logo_new.png" align="right" height="104"/>

The key objective of this open source ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="16" height="16"} package is to bring handy functions corresponding to "everyday" data processing/analysis in the EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic Resonance](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance_(Jenschke))) spectroscopy mainly in chemistry. Similar ![](https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/community/logos/python-logo-only.png){width="16" height="16"} tools like [cwepr](https://www.cwepr.de/index) and the [related projetcs](https://docs.cwepr.de/v0.5/) have been developed, so far. The `{eprscope}`, as the first complex ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="16" height="16"} **package** 📦 for EPR, **doesn't want to replace the latter nor the excellent and standard EPR simulation/processing** [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and its additional frameworks like [SpecProFi](https://www.radicals.uni-freiburg.de/de/software) or [CW EPR Scripts by Emilien Etienne](https://bip.cnrs.fr/epr-facility/software-and-scripts/). Rather, **it may be considered like a complementary** 📦 **or toolbox with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by several proprietary tools**. For instance, like acquisition/processing software, supplied by the EPR spectrometer manufacturers (see e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)) as well as several other software platforms like the *MS Office* and/or *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* which are often applied in the EPR processing/analysis workflow. Therefore, the `{eprscope}` tries to reduce such many steps/programs if the above-mentioned software combination would be adopted. In order to achieve the goal it uses superior power of the open source ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="16" height="16"} ecosystem that combines data processing, analysis and great scientific visualizations together with the extensive publishing capabilities by [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Everything at one place (see the [RStudio IDE](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/)) without the need to switch between or employ any other additional software.

## Installation

Before the installation, please make sure that you have already followed instructions for the [{nloptr} package installation](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) depending on your operating system. This package is required for the proper running of the `{eprscope}` optimization/fitting functions.

```{r installation,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}

# after the initial R-environment setup (see below) it's always 
# good to install essential collection of packages for data science 
# with all their dependencies:
# install.packages("tidyverse",dependencies = TRUE)
#
# package can be installed by =>
if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope")
#
# alternatively, install package together with the vignettes/articles:
# if (!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
# devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope",build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

Completely new <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/> users or people who haven't already installed the *R* environment, please consult the following steps prior to own `{eprscope}` installation ➨

1.  [the R installation procedure](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

2.  [installation of the Rstudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (alternatively, you may try its [cloud version](https://docs.posit.co/cloud/) without the need for ![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png){width="16" height="16"} installation)

3.  [the latest R tools release](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) **ONLY for WINDOWS OS**

Additionally, **the open-source scientific and technical publishing system** [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) together with the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), **a document converter system**, may be required for sharing the results coming from `{eprscope}` in desired formats like `pdf` , `html` , `docx` , `pptx` or `tex` (details may be found in the `create_qmdReport_proj()` documentation).

## Usage

In this section, couple of examples are shown in order to briefly demonstrate the package functionality. More detailed description can be found within the articles/vignettes or documentation examples.

### Reading Files with Instrumental Parameters

```{r parameter-reading,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# loading the package/library
library(eprscope)
#
# loading the built-in example file => "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.par"
tmpd.params.file <-
  load_data_example(file = "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.par")
#
# parameters into interactive table (data frame)
tmpd.params.dt <-
  readEPR_params_tabs(
    path_to_dsc_par = tmpd.params.file,
    origin = "winepr",
    interact = "params"
  )
#
# table preview
tmpd.params.dt

```

### Depict Molecular Structures

```{r molecule-drawing,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Pphenalenyl (Perinaphthenyl or PNT) radical by `SMILES` code:
# "C1([C.]23)=CC=CC2=CC=CC3=CC=C1"
draw_molecule_by_rcdk(
  molecule = "C1([C.]23)=CC=CC2=CC=CC3=CC=C1",
  mol.label = "Phenalenyl",
  mol.label.color = "black",
  mol.label.xy.posit = c(8.8, 1.2)
)

```

### Simulation of Isotropic EPR Spectra

```{r spectra-simulation,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# simulation of the phenalenyl (perinaphthenyl or PNT) radical,
# see also https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2006/CS/b500509b,
# the additional experimental/instrumental parameters are not shown,
# they posses their default values => see the corresponding documentation
# of `eval_sim_EPR_iso()` function.
simulation.iso <-
  eval_sim_EPR_iso(
    g.iso = 2.0027,
    B.unit = "G",
    nuclear.system = list(
      list("1H", 3, 5.09), # 3 x A(1H) = 5.09 MHz
      list("1H", 6, 17.67) # 6 x A(1H) = 17.67 MHz
    ),
    lineGL.DeltaB = list(0.24, NULL) # linewidth in G
  )
#
# simulation spectrum preview in the region from 3470 G to 3522 G
simulation.iso$plot + 
  ggplot2::coord_cartesian(xlim = c(3470, 3522))

```

### Radical Kinetic Model Fitted onto the Experimental Data

```{r kinetic-model-fit,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# decay of a triarylamine radical cation right after 
# its generation by electrochemical potentiostatic oxidation 
# in TBAPF6/CH3CN, double integrals (Areas) vs time were 
# obtained by data pre-processing within the continuous 
# wave (CW) EPR spectrometer acquisition/processing software.
#
# loading the built-in example file with instrumental parameters
triarylamine_rc_decay_dsc <-
  load_data_example(file = "Triarylamine_radCat_decay_a.DSC")
#
# loading the built-in example file with "Area" vs "time" data frame
triarylamine_rc_decay_txt <-
  load_data_example(file = "Triarylamine_radCat_decay_a.txt")
triarylamine_rc_decay_data <-
  readEPR_Exp_Specs(
    path_to_ASC = triarylamine_rc_decay_txt,
    header = TRUE,
    fill = TRUE,
    select = c(3, 7),
    col.names = c("time_s", "Area"),
    x.unit = "s",
    x.id = 1,
    Intensity.id = 2,
    qValue = 1700,
    data.structure = "others"
  ) %>% na.omit()
#
# fitting the experimental decay by 2R --> B kinetic model
# with "k1" rate constant and the corresponding partial
# rection order "alpha". "qvar0R" refers to initial
# "quantitative variable" (such as concentration, double integral
# or number of radicals) of the triarylamine radical cation "R".

    data.qt.expr = triarylamine_rc_decay_data,
    model.react = "(r=2)R --> [k1] B",
    elementary.react = FALSE,
    params.guess = c(
      qvar0R = 0.019,
      k1 = 0.04,
      alpha = 1.9
    ),
    time.correct = TRUE,
    path_to_dsc_par = triarylamine_rc_decay_dsc,
    origin = "xenon"
  )
#
# graph preview
triarylamine_rc_decay_model$plot
#

# by the non-linear fit and numeric solution
# of the Ordinary Differential Equations
