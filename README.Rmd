# Overview <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139"/>

The main goal of this package is to bring handy functions corresponding to "everyday" data processing/operations in EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic Resonance](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/E02005)) spectroscopy. The package doesn't want to replace the great EPR simulation/processing [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) . Rather, it may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by the combination of several software platforms like *MS Office*, *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* (in general graphing software) as well as acquisition/processing software supplied by the EPR spectrometer producers (see e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)). These involve the following principal operations:

-   Reading the universal ASCII data format (e.g. like `.asc`, `.txt`, `.csv`) and transforming into tables (data frames) incl. operations like intensity normalization and conversion between magnetic flux density (*B*) units ($\mathrm{G} \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{mT}$). Additionally, the available functions enable the automatic reading of time series experiments like a kinetic one (e.g. also with the combination of *in situ* electrochemistry or photochemistry/irradiation) or reading and processing several EPR spectra data/files at once for the series of individual experiments/data files upon changing the quantities like (time,microwave power, electrochemical potential, temperature, concentration...etc.). Finally, reading the *MATLAB* (`.mat`) files and the instrumental parameter ones ( in case of *BRUKER* instruments, so far[^1] ) and the corresponding parameter extraction can be performed as well.

-   Plotting the EPR spectra incl. time series/kinetics or their dependency on other quantities (like already mentioned above) as well as presentation of simulated spectra are provided by several functions based on either [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package/system (one of the most comprehensive visualization system in data science and data analytics) or interactive [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) graphing library. Especially the later ...
