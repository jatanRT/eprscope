## Overview <img src="man/figures/logo_new.png" align="right" height="139"/>

The key objective of this fully open source package is to bring handy functions corresponding to "everyday" data processing/analysis in the EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic Resonance](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance_(Jenschke))) spectroscopy mainly in chemistry. The package doesn't want to replace the excellent EPR simulation/processing [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) . Rather, it may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by several tools. Besides the acquisition/processing software, supplied by the EPR spectrometer manufacturers (see e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)), several other proprietary software platforms like *MS Office* and/or *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* might be required. Those are in general, text editing with the combination of a graphing software. Therefore, the `{eprscope}` tries to reduce many steps performed if the above-mentioned software combination would be used.

## Installation

```{r}

## So far, the package can be installed by =>

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope.git")

```

Before the installation, please make sure that you have already followed the instructions for [{nloptr} package installation](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) depending on your operating system. This package is required for the proper running of optimization/fitting functions of the `{eprscope}` .

Completely new <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/> users or if you do not have already installed the *R* environment, consult ➨

1.  [the R installation procedure](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

2.  [installation of the Rstudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3.  [the latest R tools release](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html) **ONLY for WINDOWS OS**

Additionally, **an open-source scientific and technical publishing system** [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) together with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), **a document converter system**, may be needed for sharing the results coming from `{eprscope}` in desired formats like `pdf` , `html` , `docx` , `pptx` or `tex`.

## Usage

In this section couple of examples are shown in order to briefly demonstrate functionality of the package. More detailed description can be found within the package articles/vignettes (see above).

## Help, Questions and Contribution

There are several ways how to get help. If the users are already familiar with the [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) please, follow either the individual package function documentation or the corresponding articles/vignettes on this site. These might be also considered as a suitable source for the students having not so deep knowledge about the EPR spectroscopy. **In case you are new to *R***, there are couple of great tutorials enabling a quite straightforward diving into <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/>. **Please, refer to e.g.**
