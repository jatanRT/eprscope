## Overview <img src="man/figures/logo_new.png" align="right" height="104"/>

The key objective of this fully open source package is to bring handy functions corresponding to "everyday" data processing/analysis in the EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic Resonance](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance_(Jenschke))) spectroscopy mainly in chemistry. The package doesn't want to replace the excellent EPR simulation/processing [EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) . Rather, it may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical functions which have to be otherwise performed by several tools, e.g. like by the acquisition/processing software, supplied by the EPR spectrometer manufacturers (see e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)) as well as by several other proprietary software platforms like the *MS Office* and/or *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor*. Therefore, the `{eprscope}` also tries to reduce such many steps if the above-mentioned software combination is adopted.

## Installation

```{r}

# So far, the package can be installed by =>

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope.git")

```

Before the installation, please make sure that you have already followed instructions for the [{nloptr} package installation](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) depending on your operating system. This package is required for the proper running of optimization/fitting functions of the `{eprscope}` .

Completely new <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/> users or people who haven't already installed the *R* environment, please consult ➨

1.  [the R installation procedure](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

2.  [installation of the Rstudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3.  [the latest R tools release](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html) **ONLY for WINDOWS OS**

Additionally, **an open-source scientific and technical publishing system** [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) together with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), **a document converter system**, may be needed for sharing the results coming from `{eprscope}` in desired formats like `pdf` , `html` , `docx` , `pptx` or `tex`.

## Usage

In this section couple of examples are shown in order to briefly demonstrate functionality of the package. More detailed description can be found within the package articles/vignettes or documentation examples.

### Reading Files with Instrumental Parameters

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

library(eprscope)
#
# built-in package file => "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.par"
tmpd.params.file <- 
  load_data_example(file = "TMPD_specelchem_accu_b.par")
#
# parameters into interactive table (data frame)
tmpd.params.dt <- 
  readEPR_params_tabs(path_to_dsc_par = tmpd.params.file,
                      origin = "winepr",
                      interact = "params")
#
# table preview
tmpd.params.dt

```

### Depict Molecular Structures

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Phenylalenyl (Perinaphthenyl or PNT) radical from `SMILES`
# "C1([C.]23)=CC=CC2=CC=CC3=CC=C1" code
draw_molecule_by_rcdk(molecule = "C1([C.]23)=CC=CC2=CC=CC3=CC=C1",
                      mol.label = "Phenylalenyl",
                      mol.label.color = "black",
                      mol.label.xy.posit = c(8.8,1.2))

```

### Simulation of Isotropic EPR Spectra

As an example "PNT" radical (see the structure above)

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Simulation of phenylalenyl (perinaphthenyl or PNT) radical,
# see also https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2006/CS/b500509b.
# additional experimental/instrumental parameters are not shown,
# and posses their default values => see the corresponding documentation 
# of `eval_sim_EPR_iso()` function.
#
simulation.iso <- 
  eval_sim_EPR_iso(g.iso = 2.0027,
                   B.unit = "G",
                   nuclear.system = list(list("1H",3,5.09),
                                         list("1H",6,17.67)),
                   natur.abund = T,
                   lineGL.DeltaB = list(0.42,NULL))
#
# simulation spectrum preview in the region from 3462 G to 3528 G
simulation.iso$plot + ggplot2::coord_cartesian(xlim = c(3462,3528))

```

## Help, Questions and Contribution

There are several ways how to get help. If the users are already familiar with the [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) please, follow either the individual package function documentation or the corresponding articles/vignettes. These might be also considered as a suitable source for those having not so deep knowledge about the EPR spectroscopy. **In case you are new to *R***, there are couple of great tutorials enabling a quite straightforward diving into <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width="16" height="16"/>. **Please, refer to e.g.**
