Description: Processing, analysis and plottting of 
             Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra in chemistry. 
             Even though the package is mainly focused
             on continuous wave (CW) EPR/ENDOR, many functions 
             may be also used for the integrated forms of 1D 
             PULSED EPR spectra. It is able to find the most 
             important spectral characteristics like g-factor, 
             linewidth, maximal derivative or integral intensities 
             and single/double integrals. This is especially 
             important in spectral (time) series consisting of many 
             EPR spectra like during variable temperature experiments, 
             electrochemical or photochemical radical generation 
             and/or decay. Package also enables to process 
             data/spectra for the analytical (quantitative) purposes. 
             Namely, how many radicals or paramagnetic centers 
             can be found in the analyte/sample. 
             The goal is to evaluate rate constants, 
             considering different kinetic models, to describe 
             the radical reactions. The key feature of the package 
             resides in processing of the universal ASCII text 
             formats (such as '.txt', '.csv' or '.asc') 
             from scratch. No proprietary formats are used 
             (except the MATLAB EasySpin outputs) and in such respect 
             the package is in accordance with the FAIR data 
             principles. Upon 'reading' (also providing automatic 
             procedures for the most common EPR spectrometers)
             the spectral data are transformed into the universal
             R 'data frame' format. Subsequently, the EPR spectra 
             can be visualized and are fully consistent either with 
             the 'ggplot2' package or with the interactive 
             formats based on 'plotly'. Additionally, simulations 
             and fitting of the isotropic EPR spectra
             are also included in the package. Advanced simulation 
             parameters provided by the MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox 
             and results from the quantum chemical calculations 
             like g-factor and hyperfine splitting/coupling 
             constants (a/A) can be compared and summarized 
             in table-format in order to analyze the EPR spectra 
             by the most effective way.
