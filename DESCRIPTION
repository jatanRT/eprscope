Description: Processing, analysis and plottting of 
             Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra in chemistry. 
             Even though the main emphasis is on continuous wave (CW) 
             EPR/ENDOR, many functions may be also used 
             for the integrated forms of 1D PULSED EPR spectra. 
             The primary goal is to find the most important spectral 
             characteristics like g-factor, linewidth, maximum 
             of derivative or integral intensities and single/double 
             integrals. This is especially important in spectral (time) 
             series consisting of many EPR spectra like during variable 
             temperature experiments, electrochemical or photochemical 
             radical generation and/or decay. Therefore, processing of 
             data/spectra for the analytical (quantitative) purposes
             belongs to the package core. The aim is to evaluate rate 
             constants, considering different kinetic models, 
             to describe the radical reactions. One of the key features 
             is processing of the universal ASCII text 
             format (such as '.txt', '.csv', '.asc','.dsc','.par') 
             from scratch (except the MATLAB EasySpin outputs '.mat').
             Upon 'reading' (also providing automatic 
             procedures for the most common EPR spectrometers)
             the spectral data are transformed into the universal
             R 'data frame' format. Subsequently, the EPR spectra 
             can be visualized and are fully consistent either with 
             the 'ggplot2' package or with the interactive 
             formats based on 'plotly'. Simulations 
             and fitting of the isotropic EPR spectra
             can be performed as well. In addition, the advanced 
             simulation parameters provided by the MATLAB-EasySpin 
             toolbox and results from the quantum chemical 
             calculations like g-factor and hyperfine 
             splitting/coupling constants (a/A) can be compared 
             and summarized in table-format in order to analyze 
             the EPR spectra by the most effective way. 
             Reproducible reports of the entire data processing 
             and analysis can be created by the quarto 
             publishing system.
