Description: Primary aim of the package is to process, analyze
             and plot EPR spectra in Electron Paramagnetic 
             Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in chemistry. Package 
             functions/scripts can be applied not only 
             for continuous wave (CW) EPR/ENDOR, however most 
             of them may be also used for the integrated forms in 1D 
             pulsed EPR. Package contains functions to find the most 
             important spectral characteristics like g-factor, 
             linewidth, maximal derivative or integral intensities 
             and single/double integrals, especially in spectral 
             (time) series consisting of many EPR spectra like 
             during variable temperature experiments, 
             electrochemical or photochemical radical generation 
             and/or decomposition/decay...etc. 
             Package also contains functions to process 
             data/spectra for analytical (quantitative) purposes, 
             i.e. how many radicals, paramagnetic centers 
             can be found in the analyte/sample. 
             Namely, the goal is to evaluate rate constants, 
             considering different kinetic models to describe 
             the radical reactions. The key feature of the package 
             resides in processing of the universal ASCII text 
             formats (e.g. like '.txt', '.csv' or '.asc') 
             from scratch. No proprietary formats are used 
             (except the MATLAB EasySpin outputs) and in such respect 
             the package is in accordance with the FAIR data 
             principles. Upon 'reading' (also providing automatic 
             procedures for the most common EPR spectrometers)
             the spectral data are transformed into universal
             'data frame' R format. Subsequently, the EPR spectra 
             can be plotted and are fully consistent either with 
             the 'ggplot2' package or with interactive 
             formats based on the 'plotly'. Additionally, 
             simulations of the EPR spectra in simple form 
             are included in the package. Advanced simulation 
             parameters provided by the MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox 
             and the results from quantum chemical calculations 
             like g-factor and hyperfine splitting/coupling 
             constants (a/A) can be compared and summarized 
             in table-format in order to analyze the EPR spectra 
             by the most effective way.
