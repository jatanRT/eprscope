Description: Primary aim of the package is to process and plot spectra 
    in Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. It includes functions 
    to find the most important spectral characteristics like g-factor, linewidth 
    and single/double integrals, especially in spectral (time) series consisting 
    of many EPR spectra like during electrochemical or photochemical radical generation. 
    The input-format of all EPR spectra and tables must be in ASCII format 
    (e.g. '.txt' or '.csv') which is then transformed into 'data frame'. Additionally, 
    simulations of the EPR spectra and the corresponding parameters provided 
    by MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox and the results from DFT calculations like g-factor 
    and hyperfine splitting/coupling constants (a/A) are compared and summarized 
    in table-format in order to analyze the EPR spectra in the right way.
