Description: Primary aim of the package is to process and plot spectra in Electron 
    Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. It includes functions to find the most important 
    spectral characteristics like g-factor, linewidth, maximal derivative intensities 
    and single/double integrals, especially in spectral (time) series consisting 
    of many EPR spectra like during electrochemical or photochemical radical generation and/or quenching. 
    For such purpose also rate konstant of simple 1st or 2nd order kinetic can be evaluated as well.
    The input-format of all EPR spectra and tables must be ASCII (e.g. like '.txt', '.csv' or '.asc') 
    which is then transformed into 'data frame' by the own package. Subsequently, the EPR spectra
    ('data frames') can be plotted eiher by common 'ggplot2' scripts or by package own functions. 
    Additionally, simulations of the EPR spectra and the corresponding parameters provided 
    by MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox and the results from quantum chemical calculations like 
    g-factor and hyperfine splitting/coupling constants (a/A) can be compared and summarized 
    in table-format in order to analyze the EPR spectra in the right way. Package also contains 
    functions to process data/spectra for analytical (quantitave) purposes, i.e. how many radicals,
    paramagnetic centers can be found in the analyte/sample. Finally, theoretical reactional 
    thermodynamic parameters (e.g. like G, H, S, K) from quantum chemical (QCH)
    computations can be calculated for the chemical reactions with radicals/paramagnetic
    species involved. Simulation and fitting of the experimental EPR spectra, similar
    to EasySpin Matlab toolbox is planed for the future.
