Description: Processing, analysis and plottting of 
             electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in chemistry. 
             Even though the package is mainly focused
             on continuous wave (CW) EPR/ENDOR, many functions 
             may be also used for the integrated form of the 1D pulsed 
             EPR spectra. It involves finding of the most 
             important spectral characteristics like g-factor, 
             linewidth, maximum of derivative or integral intensities, 
             single/double integrals and splittings. This is especially 
             important in spectral (time) series consisting of many 
             EPR spectra like during variable temperature experiments, 
             electrochemical or photochemical radical generation 
             and/or decay. Package also enables processing of 
             data/spectra for the analytical (quantitative) purposes. 
             Namely, how many radicals or paramagnetic centers 
             can be found in the analyte/sample. 
             The goal is to evaluate rate constants, 
             considering different kinetic models, to describe 
             the radical reactions. Following the reading of EPR data 
             from the instrument (also providing automatic 
             procedures for the most common EPR spectrometers),
             data are transformed into the universal
             R 'data frame' format and thus might be additionally 
             processed and analyzed by the R 'tidyverse' bundle. 
             Subsequently, the EPR spectra can be visualized 
             and are fully consistent either with the 'ggplot2' package 
             or with the interactive formats based on 'plotly'. 
             Additionally, simulations and fitting of the isotropic 
             EPR spectra are included as well. Advanced simulation 
             parameters from the MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox 
             and results from the quantum chemical 
             calculations (e.g. DFT), like g-factor and hyperfine 
             splitting/coupling constants (a/A), can be compared 
             with the experiment and summarized in a table-like format 
             in order to analyze the EPR spectra by the most effective way.
             Finally, all outcomes may be summarized in a quarto '.qmd'
             document rendered/converted into different formats 
             (e.g. '.pdf','.docx','.html').
