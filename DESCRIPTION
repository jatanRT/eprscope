Description: Primary aim of the package is to process and plot spectra in Electron 
    Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. It includes functions to find the most important 
    spectral characteristics like g-factor, linewidth, maximal derivative intensities 
    and single/double integrals, especially in spectral (time) series consisting 
    of many EPR spectra like during electrochemical or photochemical radical generation 
    and/or decomposition/decay. For such purpose also rate konstant of simple 
    1st or 2nd order kinetics can be evaluated as well. The input-format of all EPR spectra 
    and tables must be ASCII (e.g. like '.txt', '.csv' or '.asc') which is then transformed 
    into 'data frame' by the own package. Subsequently, the EPR spectra ('data frames') can be plotted 
    eiher by common 'ggplot2' scripts or by package own functions incl. interactive formats 
    based on 'plotly' package. Additionally, simulations of the EPR spectra and the corresponding 
    parameters provided by MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox and the results from quantum chemical calculations 
    like g-factor and hyperfine splitting/coupling constants (a/A) can be compared and summarized 
    in table-format in order to analyze the EPR spectra. Package also contains 
    functions to process data/spectra for analytical (quantitative) purposes, i.e. how many radicals,
    paramagnetic centers can be found in the analyte/sample. Finally, theoretical reactional 
    thermodynamic parameters (e.g. like G, H, S, K) from quantum chemical (QCH)
    computations and quantitative EPR as well as simulation and fitting of the experimental EPR spectra, 
    similar to EasySpin Matlab toolbox, are planed for the future.
