Description: Primary aim of the package is to process, analyze
             and plot EPR spectra in Electron Paramagnetic 
             Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and Electron-Nuclear 
             Double Resonance (ENDOR). Package functions/scripts
             can be applied not only for continuous wave (CW) 
             EPR/ENDOR, however most of them may be also used 
             for pulsed EPR. Package contains functions to find
             the most important spectral characteristics 
             like g-factor, linewidth, maximal derivative
             or integral intensities and single/double 
             integrals, especially in spectral (time) series 
             consisting of many EPR spectra like during variable
             temperature experiments, electrochemical 
             or photochemical radical generation 
             and/or decomposition/decay...etc. 
             Package also contains functions to process 
             data/spectra for analytical (quantitative) purposes, 
             i.e. how many radicals, paramagnetic centers 
             can be found in the analyte/sample. 
             For such objective also rate constants considering
             different kinetic models can be evaluated as well. 
             The key feature of the package resides in processing
             of the universal ASCII text formats 
             (e.g. like '.txt', '.csv' or '.asc') from scratch. 
             No proprietary formats are used and in this respect
             the package is in accordance with the FAIR data 
             principles. Upon 'reading' (also providing automatic 
             procedures for most common EPR spectrometers)
             the spectral data are transformed into universal
             'data frame' R format. Subsequently, the EPR spectra 
             ('data frames') can be plotted and are fully
             consistent with the 'ggplot2' package or interactive 
             formats based on 'plotly'. Additionally, simulations
             of the EPR spectra and the corresponding parameters
             provided by MATLAB-EasySpin toolbox and the results 
             from quantum chemical calculations
             like g-factor and hyperfine splitting/coupling 
             constants (a/A) can be compared and summarized 
             in table-format in order to analyze the EPR spectra.
