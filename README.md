# Overview <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139"/>

The main goal of this package is to bring handy functions corresponding
to “everyday” data processing/operations in EPR ([Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/E02005)) spectroscopy.
The package doesn’t want to replace the great EPR simulation/processing
[EasySpin Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) . Rather, it
may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical
functions which have to be otherwise performed by the combination of
several software platforms like *MS Office*, *Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* (in
general graphing software) as well as acquisition/processing software
supplied by the EPR spectrometer producers (see
e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)).
These involve the following principal operations:

- Reading the universal ASCII data format (e.g. like `.asc`, `.txt`,
  `.csv`) and transforming into tables (data frames) incl. operations
  like intensity normalization, conversion between magnetic flux density
  ($B$) units ($\mathrm{G} \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{mT}$). Additionally,
  the available functions enable the automatic reading of time series
  experiments like in kinetic series (e.g. also with the combination of
  *in situ* electrochemistry or photochemistry/irradiation) or reading
  and processing several EPR spectra data/files at once for the series
  of individual experiments
