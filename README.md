# Overview <img src="man/figures/logo_new.png" align="right" height="139"/>

The key objective of this fully open source package is to bring handy
functions corresponding to “everyday” data processing/analysis in EPR
([Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Electron_Paramagnetic_Resonance_(Jenschke)))
spectroscopy mainly in chemistry. The package doesn’t want to replace
the great EPR simulation/processing [EasySpin
Toolbox](https://www.easyspin.org/) for
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) . Rather, it
may be considered like a complimentary package/toolbox with practical
functions which have to be otherwise performed by the
acquisition/processing software, supplied by the EPR spectrometer
manufacturers (see
e.g. [*Xenon/WinEPR*](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/mr/epr-instruments/epr-software.html)),
and/or by several proprietary software platforms like *MS Office* and/or
*Orgin/SigmaPlot/Igor* i.e. in general text editing in combination with
a graphing software.

# Installation

``` r
## So far, the package can be installed by =>

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("jatanRT/eprscope.git")
```

Before the installation of `{eprscope}`, please make sure that you have
already followed the instructions for `{nloptr}` [package
installation](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) depending on the
operating system. This package is required for the proper running of
optimization/fitting functions of the `{eprscope}` .
